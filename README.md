# news_paper
This is a fullstack project where user can read news. I use react redux toolkit for state mgt. 
I used react-bootsrap for styling while form validation was done with formik and yup respectively.
The backend was a public API  that is open to anyone for testing.
To run this projec
you need to run
#npm install - for all the packages
#npm run jserv - for the BE
#npm run dev - for the FE
this simply means you will need two terminals to fully utilize the project.
